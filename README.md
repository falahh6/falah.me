# Portfolio Project - [falahh.me](https://falah.vercel.app/)

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio project! This project showcases my web development skills using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It includes two main pages: the Home page and the Contact Me page. The project utilizes Supabase to store and manage 'Contact Me' requests submitted through the website.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js: Next.js is a React framework that allows for server-side rendering and helps build modern, scalable web applications.
- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-built styles, making it easy to create responsive and visually appealing designs.
- Supabase: Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, providing a flexible and scalable backend for data storage and management.

## Pages

### Home Page

The Home page serves as an introduction to my portfolio. It showcases my skills, projects, and any other relevant information to impress potential visitors and employers.

### Contact Me Page

The Contact Me page enables visitors to get in touch with me. It features a form where users can submit their inquiries, feedback, or any other messages they wish to communicate with me. The data submitted through this form is stored securely in Supabase tables, ensuring I can promptly respond to their requests.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Ensure you have set up a Supabase account and have access to the necessary credentials (API keys, etc.).
4. Update the Supabase configuration in the project to connect to your Supabase account.
5. Run the development server using the provided command (e.g., `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`).
6. Access the portfolio website on your local server (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

To deploy the portfolio project to production, follow these steps:

1. Configure your deployment settings and build process for Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
2. Ensure the Supabase credentials are set correctly for the production environment.
3. Deploy the application to your chosen hosting platform.
